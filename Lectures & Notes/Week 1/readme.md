## Week 1: Foundations of Data Structures & Algorithms

## 📂 Topics Covered

### 1. Introduction to Data Structures
* Why efficient data storage matters.
* The difference between Data Structures and Algorithms.
* Basic complexity concepts (Time vs. Space trade-offs).

### 2. Abstract Data Types (ADTs)
* **Definition:** Understanding ADTs as a logical description of data (The "What") vs. the implementation (The "How").
* **Examples:** Lists, Stacks, Queues.
* **Key Concept:** Encapsulation and hiding implementation details.

### 3. Searching Algorithms
We covered the two fundamental methods for finding data:

#### 🔍 Linear Search
* **Method:** Iterating through a list one by one.
* **Best for:** Unsorted or small datasets.
* **Complexity:** $O(n)$ (Worst case: element is at the end or not present).

#### ⚡ Binary Search
* **Method:** The "Divide and Conquer" approach. repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
* **Requirement:** The list **MUST** be sorted.
* **Complexity:** $O(\log n)$ (Much faster for large datasets).

## 📝 Exam Cheat Sheet (Quick Recap)
* **ADT** = Logical Interface.
* **Linear Search** = Slow, works on unsorted data.
* **Binary Search** = Fast, requires sorted data.
